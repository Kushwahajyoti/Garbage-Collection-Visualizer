# Garbage Collection Visualizer

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Garbage Collection Visualizer** is an interactive tool designed to illustrate how memory management and garbage collection work in programming languages. This project provides a visual representation of memory allocation, object references, and garbage collection processes.

## 🎯 Features
- **Live Memory Visualization**: Watch how objects are allocated and deallocated in real time.
- **Multiple GC Algorithms**: Supports visualization of different garbage collection techniques like Mark-Sweep, Reference Counting, and Generational GC.
- **Custom Object Allocation**: Users can create and delete objects dynamically to see how the GC reacts.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Allows pausing and stepping through the garbage collection process.
- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use interface with detailed explanations.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js/D3.js for visualization)
- **Algorithms**: Mark-Sweep, Reference Counting, Generational GC

## 🛠 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kushwahajyoti/Garbage-Collection-Visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Garbage-Collection-Visualizer
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```sh
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Object Creation**: Create objects and assign references in the simulation.
2. **Garbage Generation**: Break references to generate garbage data.
3. **Garbage Collection**: Watch the visual representation of different GC techniques.
4. **Analyze Memory**: See which objects survive and how memory is freed.



## 🏗 Future Enhancements
- Support for additional GC algorithms (e.g., Copying GC, Concurrent GC)
- Improved UI with animations
- Performance analysis tools
- Export and save simulation states
